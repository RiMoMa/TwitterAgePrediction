# TwitterAgePrediction

TwitterAgePrediction is a repository that contains a machine learning model for predicting the age of Twitter users based on their tweets. The model uses natural language processing techniques to extract features from the text of tweets and then applies a regression algorithm to predict the user's age.

The repository contains the source code for the machine learning model, as well as instructions for how to train and use the model. It also includes sample data for training and testing the model, as well as a script for collecting tweets from the Twitter API.

The goal of this repository is to provide a tool for researchers and developers who are interested in studying the relationship between age and language use on social media. By accurately predicting the age of Twitter users, researchers can gain insights into how language use varies across different age groups, and how these variations might be related to other factors such as gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
